# Zepto-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL
A clean and powerful SQL-only project where I analyzed, cleaned, and transformed Zepto product data to generate business insights like revenue, stock patterns, and product segmentation — all using advanced SQL queries.

A complete end-to-end data analysis project performed using ONLY SQL queries
🚀 Project Overview
This project is a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow built entirely with SQL, designed to replicate real industry-level data analytics tasks using the Zepto product dataset. The aim was to transform raw, unstructured data into meaningful business insights without relying on Python, Excel, or BI tools—showcasing pure SQL capability.
Throughout the project, I worked with thousands of product records containing pricing details, discounts, category information, stock levels, and weights. I began with data profiling and validation, ensuring the dataset was clean and consistent. This included identifying null values, removing incorrect entries like zero-priced products, and converting paise into rupees for accurate financial calculations.

Once cleaned, the data was analyzed to answer real business questions such as:
-Which categories generate the highest potential revenue?
-What products are out of stock despite having a high MRP?
-How many products fall under low, medium, or bulk weight categories?
-Are there anomalies like incorrect pricing or missing values?
-How is the inventory distributed across categories and stock statuses?

Using grouping, filtering, aggregations, and CASE statements, I extracted insights related to revenue forecasting, category performance, customer demand patterns, and inventory health. These insights reflect common tasks performed by analysts in e-commerce and retail companies.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong SQL expertise, attention to detail, and data-driven thinking. It highlights my ability to clean, process, and analyze real-world data solely through SQL queries and convert raw tables into actionable business intelligence.
